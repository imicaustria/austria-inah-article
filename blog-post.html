        Consumer demands escalates rapidly in a high rate every few months. Crops, foods, technologies, and thousands more products are being created, repacked, delivered, and processed every single day. Imagine billions and billions of these products in a fatory with these machines and people. That surely takes a lot of energy and definitely sucks all the life that is in there, truly daunting! But we are not here to talk about just that. We are to tackle what impact does it create to us; what did we set us up for? </article>
